# mmcurses

A small c++ library to somewhat ease ncurses programming

# Documentation

The library is small enough to provide the documentation in the header files in src/mmcurses/ or ($PREFIX/include/mmcurses/ if installed).

# Building and Installation

Change into the root of the source distribution and then perform these steps:

<pre>
mkdir bld
cd bld
cmake ..
make
make install
</pre>

NOTE: The last step might have to be performed as superuser.
